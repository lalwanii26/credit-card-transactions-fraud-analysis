About the dataset:
- This is a collection of about 100,000 real card transaction records from a US government organization, it looks like somewhere in Tennessee.
- I got it from an author’s website - Mark Nigrini, an expert in applying Benford’s law for forensic accounting. The data has since disappeared from his website.
- Only 10 fields, but enough for us to build a traditional credit card transaction fraud algorithm.
